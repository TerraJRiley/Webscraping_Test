# Webscraping_Test
The results of me a test to see how much and how well I can gather data from Facebook in less than 24 hours.

Neither the data that was used to initially gather the data, nor the data that was the result of this scraping are included in this folder for the privacy of those on who's data has been collected.

Desired Future Improvements:
 - Progress Saving Redundancy incase the data corrupts or something
 - Data Collection to allow for troubleshooting.
 - More complete documentation of what all the code does and how to use it.
 - Bug Squishing: issues loading current scrape file
 - A scraper (in it's own notebook) that specifically goes back through all the data and either double checks it's accuracy or checks if there's missing data and if that data really is not uncoverable
 - Identification of the profile keys that lead to a lock (is, being unable to see said profile)
 - Figure out how to offload the processing power onto my GPU instead of my CPU?
